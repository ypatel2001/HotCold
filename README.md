Hi! My name is Yash Patel and I built as a side project to learn tkinter and basics of program design.
It is a useful and lightweight temperature converter program built using Python and tkinter. 
You can enter select to enter your own temperatures to convert or to use the read and write functions to grab, convert and write the converted temperatures a file.
Please feel free to use the code provided for your own projects or learning.
Thank you!
